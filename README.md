👋 Hi, I'm Raduan Alam

Engineer | Researcher | Builder of Intelligent Systems

My work sits at the intersection of:
- 🧠 Deep Learning & AI  
- 🤖 Robotics & Autonomous Systems  
- 👁️ Computer Vision & Perception

I care deeply about solving real-world problems with scalable, ethical AI — the kind that drives the future at places like **Tesla**, **OpenAI**, and **DeepMind**. Whether it's designing an autonomous system that navigates the world or teaching a model to understand what it sees, I believe the future belongs to those who build boldly and think clearly.
