# 👋 Hi, I'm Raduan Alam

I'm an aspiring data scientist and engineer who loves exploring the **infinite potential of data and machine learning**.

I enjoy building impactful projects and working with real-world datasets that challenge my thinking and help me grow as a problem solver. Whether it's detecting patterns, making predictions, or improving decisions — I’m always curious to see what data can reveal.



## 🧠 My Interests

I'm deeply interested in **all major fields of data science and machine learning**, including:

- Predictive Modeling
- Natural Language Processing
- Computer Vision
- Recommendation Systems
- AI Ethics
- Statistical Analysis
- Real-world Decision Making
- And more — always learning, always exploring



## 🧪 Featured Projects

| Project | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [🧠 Fake News Forensics](https://github.com/raduan-alam/fake-news-forensics) | A lightweight, interpretable fake news detection model built from scratch with a focus on statistical features and explainability. |
| [🎓Student Dropout Predictor](https://github.com/raduan-alam/student-dropout-predictor) | A high-performance LightGBM model to predict student dropout risk with SHAP explainability.  



## 🛠️ Skills

`Python` • `C` • `C++` • `Pandas` • `Scikit-learn` • `NLP` • `Git` • `Data Visualization` • `Streamlit`

Currently diving deeper into:  
`XGBoost` • `SHAP` • `Model Evaluation Techniques` • `Full-stack ML Deployment` • `Advanced Statistical Thinking`



## 📚 Currently Learning

- Designing and deploying real-world ML systems
