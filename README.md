# 👋 Hi, I'm Raduan Alam

🎓 Future Data Scientist | Research-Driven ML Explorer | Social Impact Focused 
I design machine learning projects that explore the **real-world implications of AI** — from how misinformation spreads to how education systems fail silently. I believe the next generation of AI practitioners must not only build models, but also question them.

---

## 💡 Core Themes I Explore

- **AI + Ethics**: Understanding and mitigating algorithmic bias in high-stakes decisions 
- **ML for Society**: Tackling misinformation, dropout prediction, and systemic inequality 
- **Explainability > Accuracy**: Making machine learning interpretable and accountable

---

## 🧠 Active Research Projects

🔍 **Fake News Forensics** 
An NLP-based forensic investigation of how emotionally charged and structurally manipulated content drives misinformation virality during elections.

🎓 **Dropout Risk XAI** 
Interpretable decision tree models for early identification of students at risk of dropping out — with fairness audits and visual reasoning paths.

🧪 **Upcoming**: *Model Bias Audit Toolkit* 
A lightweight diagnostic framework for testing fairness and group-wise performance in scikit-learn classifiers.
